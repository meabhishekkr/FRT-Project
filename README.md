# TravelMate

[Click here for the demo of the project]

### Aim and Objectives:
The main aim for developing this project is to develop a ready to go platform for tourists and travellers where one can get almost every information in a very structured way about the place, he/she wants to visit, like its significance, attractions around the place, inhabitant's sentiments towards the tourists and the place, etc.
As we keep witnessing the incidents like tourists getting misbehaved by the local people for hurting their cultural sentiments. Also from my personal experiences, I can say that many times we need some stuff and the stuff is not available or we can say accessible at the place like medical services, and many other things.

### Approach and Tools Used:
This project will be providing a good amount of information about the all the place with some special tips which will help visitors in planning their trips easily and enjoying them safely. Also there is a feedback form for suggestions, user want to give. The data from the feedback form is being stored in an azure cosmos database account.
